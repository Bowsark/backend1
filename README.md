Hereâ€™s a summary of the backend setup for the ShopSmart project:

Database Setup (MongoDB): Configured a MongoDB database using Mongoose to manage collections like users, products, orders, and carts.

User Authentication (JWT): Implemented JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication, issuing tokens at login and validating them on protected routes.

Product Management API: Created endpoints for adding, updating, viewing, and deleting products, with access restricted to authorized users.

Shopping Cart Functionality: Developed cart functionality, allowing users to add, update, and remove items from their cart, with each cart linked to a specific user.

Order Processing: Built order processing routes for creating new orders, viewing order history, and clearing the cart after purchase.

This backend setup enables secure data handling, product management, and e-commerce functionality for the ShopSmart website.
